- Options descriptions for Gurobi and cbc

- Testdrive MCDA + Table
- Testdrive Sensi + Grap
- Testdrive TwoWay + Graph

- Save and load for multi-models

- adopt GUI for new case



GUI and Modeling changes:
---------------------------

- Include hidden sheet for component data base ? 
- Restructure Reaction input:
	1) One area for stoichmetric reactions 
	2) One area for yield reactions


- Restructure Systemdata sheet --> 
	1) General data area
	2) Multi-run data area
	3) Components and reactions area
	4) Utility area

- Restructure Pools area
	1) delete input Productpool

- Restructure Reactors:
	1) Change layout of sheet for input of reaction based on changes system data layout
	2) Lock efficiency value for all types but Generators
	3) Lock temperature for Generators
	4) Rename Turnover-Parameters


Modeling optimization
-----------------------
- Reactions not for every unit, but once and than only conversion factors
- Prescaler for problem ?

Larger Projects:
- Databases for known processes
- Load from Databases into excel ?
- Save results to Excel file 
- Enhance GUI 
- Monte-Carlo integration ?
- Energy balance optimization ?
- Drag and drop GUI 
- Link to external models --> EG Gibbs reactor to yield + Energy data
