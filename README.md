# Hi you're probably looking for the interactive version of OUTDOOR
Currently We're waiting to release the latest version of OUTDOOR until we have one of our works published (should be soon!). Make sure to check out my github profile https://github.com/llvdrhau for updates.

We're also holding a training event in Santiago de Compostela with the latest version of the software! If you want to attend make sure you allpy before 25/05/2025 (Dead line has been extended). you can find more information in the file  [Flyer Event](./Flyer_Agriloop Training School.pdf).


# OUTDOOR_public
This repo containts the superstructure modeling framework OUTDOOR developed by Phillip Kenkel (philipp.kenkel@arcelormittal.com) and updated by Lucas Van der Hauwaert (lucas.vanderhauwaert@usc.es)
In the "examples" folder you can find 2 Lucas_small_example.py and Phillip_small_example.py.
Hopefully this will get you going. To date no proper documentation has been made and errors might still be present in the code, so be wary of results.
The compleet mathematical model is described in the dissertation of Phillpp Kenkel (Dissertation_PhilippKenkel.pdf) .

Some features and case studies have been ommited as they have not been published yet.

The model works best if you have a Gurobi license which is free if you're an academic. If you do not have a Gurobi license, you can use the open-source solver CBC.

If you want to cite this work please use the following publication https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-88506-5.50065-6


IMORTANT NOTICE: This is a temporary repo, currently we are building a user friendly interface for the model which will
hopefully be available by the end of May with proper documentation. Follow https://github.com/llvdrhau for updates.
