# OUTDOOR_public
This repo containts the superstructure modeling framework OUTDOOR developed by Phillip Kenkel (philipp.kenkel@arcelormittal.com) and updated by Lucas Van der Hauwaert (lucas.vanderhauwaert@usc.es)
In the example folder you can find 2 examples of the framework. Some features and case studies have been ommited as they have not been published yet. 


The model works best if you have a Gurobi license. If you do not have a Gurobi license, you can use the open-source solver CBC.

If you want to cite this work please use the following publication https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-88506-5.50065-6 


p.s. This is a temporary repo, currently we are building a user freindly interface for the model which will hopefully be available by the end of may.
